## GPU101 PiA Project
<p align="justify">
This repository contains my implementation of an algorithm that speeds up the calculation of a Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication through parallelizing the process.
It is implemented using C CUDA.
</p>

## Usage

You only need NVCC to compile the source
the various programs, which you should already have installed if you did already setup your maching for CUDA.
To compile all the examples simply type
```
make
```
Within the scope of this folder.
Note that the examples are all compiled using the -O3 flag, you have to use this flag also when compiling the GPU version of the code using nvcc.
All the parameters regarding input settings CANNOT BE CHANGED.
The Smith-Waterman algorithm is the only one that generates all the inputs at runtime, while for SYMGS and SPMV you should also use a sparse matrix as input (the program will not run without it).
SPMV and SYMGS GPU implementation will not produce the same results as for the CPU implementation, even when implementing a correct design, this is due to how floating point operations are implemented on GPU, to assure correctness then, check that the error rate is below a certain threshold (<0.1% error rate should be fine).

The one you should use for all of your comparisons has already been prepared for you and is available here:

You can fork this repo and use this as a starting point for your project.
Remember to include all your source code as well as a PDF (4/5 pages) with your project report in the repository.
As part of your final submission you should also prepare and present a set of slides about your project.
Please DO NOT send me your repository, instead write the address of your repo in this shared google drive:

For the sake of convenience here is also the file containing the assigned project for all the partecipants to GPU-101.

Projects are due June 7th AOE.

NOTE: you cannot change your assigned project, and copying each others project will be considered cheating and will result in you not passing the course.
